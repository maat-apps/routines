 * here is also a valid deep link (hard refresh, PWA relaunch, a bookmarked
 * URL), and on a fresh document load there's nothing of the app's own
 * behind it in session history, so popping blindly would leave the app
 * instead of landing on a sensible screen. React Router marks that case
 * with the location key "default"; anything else is a real in-app push
 * with a real entry behind it, safe to pop with `navigate(-1)`.
